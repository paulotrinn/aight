}
```

## Configuration Examples

### Automation Example
```yaml

  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.living_room_motion
    to: "on"
condition:
  - condition: sun
    after: sunset
action:
  - service: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room_main
```

### Script Example
```yaml
alias: "Good Night Routine"
