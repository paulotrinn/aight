## Overview

Transform the AI Configuration Assistant from a form-based interface to a natural conversational chat experience that guides users through creating Home Assistant configurations using natural language.

## User Stories

### Natural Language Configuration

As a Home Assistant user, I want to describe what I want in plain English, so that I don't need to understand YAML syntax or configuration structure.

The user opens the AI Config panel and types "Turn on the lights when I get home after sunset". The assistant recognizes the intent, detects relevant entities (lights, presence detection), confirms them with the user, and generates a working automation. The entire interaction feels like chatting with a helpful assistant rather than filling out technical forms.

### Iterative Configuration Refinement

As a user creating complex automations, I want to refine my configuration through conversation, so that I can add conditions and actions step by step.

After creating a basic automation, the user can continue the conversation: "Also turn on the TV" or "But only on weekdays". The assistant maintains context and updates the configuration accordingly, showing the changes in real-time.

## Spec Scope

1. **Chat-First Interface** - Replace current form with a conversational chat UI featuring message bubbles, typing indicators, and smooth animations
2. **Smart Entity Detection** - Automatically detect and confirm entities from natural language with inline confirmation cards
3. **Configuration Preview** - Show generated configurations directly in the chat flow with syntax highlighting and action buttons
4. **Context Management** - Maintain conversation context to allow iterative refinement and multi-turn interactions
5. **Enhanced Input Methods** - Support text input with autocomplete, quick action buttons, and template shortcuts

## Out of Scope

- Voice input/output (Phase 3)
- Machine learning for pattern recognition (Phase 3)
- Multi-configuration workspaces (Phase 3)
- Configuration version history (Future)
- Collaborative editing (Future)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can create configurations through natural conversation without seeing any forms
2. The interface automatically detects entities and requests confirmation inline
3. Generated configurations appear in the chat with options to copy, edit, or deploy directly
